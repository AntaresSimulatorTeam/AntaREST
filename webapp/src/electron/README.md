# Electron backend for desktop version

This is the source code for the electron main process, i.e the electron "backend",
as opposed to the frontend code which is shared with the web application.

In order to run the desktop application in dev mode run:
```bash
npm run dev  # run the front
npm run dev:electron  # start the electron app
```
