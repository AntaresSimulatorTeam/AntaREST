# How to Upgrade a Study?

## Introduction

Upgrading versioned studies is an important step to ensure compatibility of your studies with the latest versions of
Antares Web and Antares Simulator. This upgrade is necessary because some earlier versions may be deprecated and no
longer supported.

The upgrade process involves updating your study to the latest available version, using an automated process that
ensures consistency of results across versions. This upgrade may include minor or major changes to the structure of the
study.Generally, the changes are related to the configuration, the creation of new folders to take into account new
functionalities (adequacy patch, xpansion, etc.) but also the upgrade of matrices.

> Please note that upgrading your study to the latest version of Antares Simulator does not automatically enable new
> features, and may require manual adjustments to your study to take full advantage of the new capabilities.

We strongly recommend upgrading your studies to the latest version to take advantage of all the new features, and
improvements in Antares Web and Antares Simulator. If you encounter any difficulties during the upgrade, please do not
hesitate to contact our support team for assistance.
