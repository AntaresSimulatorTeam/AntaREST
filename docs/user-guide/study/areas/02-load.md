On the load page, you will find the time series matrices composed of 8760 rows (hourly for a simulation year)
and 1 column for each Monte-Carlo year.

The available commands are:

- **Assign a Matrix:** Search and assign a matrix from the matrix store to the load.
- **Import:** Drag and drop a TSV file to update the time series matrices.
- **Export:** Download the current TSV file using the "Export" button.

You can edit a cell and confirm with the "Enter" key.
You can also edit a group of cells or an entire column and confirm with the "Ctrl+Enter" key combination.

The detailed configuration is available in the [Antares Simulator documentation](https://antares-simulator.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference-guide/04-active_windows/#load).

Explore these features to customize the ST Storage settings according to the specific needs of your study.
